This is a text-based arena fighter that I created as my final project in CS-1410 at Snow College. The original idea I had was for an RPG with combat based on The Legend Of The Five Rings 4th Edition. However, due to time constraints and full-time jobs, we ended up with a Mortal Kombat-like arena style game where the player would create their character, then fight five fighters. The fighters were all other classmates and our professor, and there's cringy inside jokes on full display here.

Still, I can't let this one go. It was my first bigger project, and we worked hard on it. We had a basic understanding of inheritance and pointers when we set out to make this, but by the end we had learned tenfold. This project displays good use of Object-Oriented Programming, an understanding of C++, and the ability to buckle-down and get something done.
